//chose flat roof
//daydream
I remember all the fond memories grandpa and grandma had with the porch. 
They often climbed up on the roof to see the sunrise or sunset together. 
They didn’t always agree with one another but I remember how fond they were of each other. 
Maybe Rebecca would like to stargaze together...

//Shake head
Why am I thinking about her now? 
Wasn’t the whole reason for going here to not do that? 
Oh well. What’s next on the list?
