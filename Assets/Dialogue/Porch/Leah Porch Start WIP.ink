//looking over it
This doesn’t seem stable anymore, it’s so decayed. 
As good a place to start as any I guess. 
I want it to look like it used to, how grandpa built it. 
How was it that it looked now again...? //thinking pose

//chosen roof
Right, it was [choice] roof for the porch. 
I’ll need to draw up a blueprint first, 
good thing I brought my sketchpad with me. 
Let’s get to work!
