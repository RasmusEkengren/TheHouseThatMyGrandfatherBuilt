 I never expected that renovating grandpa’s old house would lead to seeing things from a new perspective. 
 I have to thank you grandpa, you left me one last life lesson through this house. 
 You made me realize that I can’t keep running away like I have. 
 It’s time to actually do something about it all, to find the next step in my journey to heal. 
 Maybe Rebecca can help me find that next step, just like grandma and grandpa always did for each other.
