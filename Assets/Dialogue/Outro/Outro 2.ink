I have to thank you, grandpa. You gave me a new perspective on my life I didn’t know I needed. 
I have to thank you for that grandpa, you always did look out for me. 
You made me realise I can’t keep running away like I have. 
I need to actually do something about it all, to find the next step in my journey to heal from the past. 
Maybe Rebecca can help me find my next step, just like grandpa and grandma always did for each other.
