Back where it started now. 
My grandpa and grandma had their differences but they always trusted one another, their relationship felt safe and warm. 
When I visited, I mattered in a way I often did not otherwise. 
Maybe that’s why I blew up like I did… 
Maybe there’s more to the fight I had with Rebecka than I first thought.
