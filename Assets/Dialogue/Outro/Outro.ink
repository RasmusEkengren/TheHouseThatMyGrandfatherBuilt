This has been an eye-opening experience. A much needed one. 
There’s more to the fight I had with Rebecca than I first thought… 
This house has reminded me about how safe my grandparents made me feel. 
Their relationship and trust in each other felt safe and warm. 
And when I visited, I mattered to them in a way I often did not otherwise… 
Maybe that’s part of the reason I blew up like I did.
