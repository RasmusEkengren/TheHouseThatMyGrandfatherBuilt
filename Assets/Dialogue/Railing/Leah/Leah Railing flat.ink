This looks really stable! Gotta pat myself on the back for this one.
I used to balance on top of the railing all the time. It was one of those things all kids do, y’know? 
When I first started doing it, grandma Hilda was so worried I’d fall and hurt myself. 
But she soon realized that all she had to do was bribe me with some of her raspberry pie and I’d come down.
I miss those simple days of being allowed to just be a kid. 
They didn’t last long… //shake head 
What’s next on the list?
