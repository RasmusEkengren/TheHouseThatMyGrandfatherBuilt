This looks really stable! Gotta pat myself on the back for this one.
One of the planks had loosened and fallen off when I visited once. 
Being the kid I was, always looking for new ways to play, I seized the opportunity and 
used the remaining plank as a monkey bar and swung myself back and forth in the newly made gap. 
Grandpa never ended up replacing it.
I miss those simple days of being allowed to just be a kid. They didn’t last long… //shakes head 
What’s next on the list?
