I hadn’t talked to my grandpa in years, yet he chose me to inherit his house. 
When I got the letter stating such, Rebecca wanted to talk about moving in together, again. 
I had always loved the countryside and this seemed like an ideal start to her. 
She didn’t want to listen to me, so I fled. There was too much going on in my head for me to stay. 
I hoped that going to my grandpa’s old house would give me a moment of respite, it held a lot of fond memories. 
The house my grandfather built.
