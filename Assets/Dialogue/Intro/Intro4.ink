I hoped that giving myself time on my own would help settle things. That it would help settle my thoughts by allowing myself to focus on something else. 
To remember times that were easier to understand and held bright memories. 
To focus on the past and remember all the stories my grandpa always told me about his house and how much love and care went into it. 
The house my grandfather built.
