I fled to the very house that had started it all, the house I had just inherited. To get away from the city and everything in it. 
I wanted to run away from the fear I held of repeating the same mistakes I had seen from others in the past. 
It wasnâ€™t the brightest idea to run away from the problem like that and I wish I had left on a better note. 
But with the fear and grief clouding my mind, it was hard to resist the urge.
