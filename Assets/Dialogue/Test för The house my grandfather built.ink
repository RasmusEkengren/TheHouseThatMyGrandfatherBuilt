I remember the day clearly, when I got the key to my Grandfather’s house. It came as a shock that he chose me to have it when he passed away. 
Since my father left, I haven’t been able to keep in contact with Grandfather. If I hadn’t gotten that letter, I wouldn’t have even known that he passed away.
Now when I had gotten a house in the countryside, just like I had wanted, Rebecca started to talk more about moving in together. 
We had been an official couple for two years then, she felt ready to move onto the next step. But with the grief of my grandfather’s passing still lingering, I made it into a fight. 
I said things I regret, things I shouldn’t have, and fled.
I fled to the house I had just gotten. To get away from the city. To run away from the fear I had of the past repeating itself in our relationship. 
It wasn’t the best way to get away from that kind of problem, I wish I had left on a lighter note, but it was hard to resist the urge to flee with fear and grief clouding my mind.
I hoped that some time on my own would settle things. Settle my thoughts as I could focus on something else. Focus on the past, when times were a lot easier and brighter. 
Focus on the past where my grandpa used to tell stories about his house and how much he cherished it. The house my grandfather built.
